Code written for the Digital Shaper Program, Data Science Track, at Techlabs (Aachen, Germany), 2020-2021 (6 months).
It includes exercises, and part of the code I wrote for the following group project:

Discovering Machine Learning Models and Features for Predicting Scheduled Patient Examination Volume at the MGH.
    
The project was executed in collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and aimed to optimize the planning of diagnostics exams. More precisely, the number of patient exams that would be completed at different time points in the future needed to be predicted based on basic logistic data plus own features engineered. The goal of this project was, among others, to analyze the differences between prediction models built with traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

The project report can be found as .doc file in the project folder, or here: https://techlabs-aachen.medium.com/discovering-machine-learning-models-and-features-for-predicting-scheduled-patient-examination-ce8e66e3a6b9.
